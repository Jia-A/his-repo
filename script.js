//Difference between var, let and const

// 1. var variables can be redeclared, reassigned and can be initialised later on.
// 2. let variables can be reassigned but not redecalred and can be initialised later on.
// 3. const variables cannot be reassigned, redeclared and needs to be initialised at the time of declaration.

//Extra points about var, let and const
// initialization can only happen once.
// You should not use var to declare variables.
// Try to use const as much as possible otherwise use let.

// Naming conventions
// ALL VARIABLES ARE CASE SENSITIVE means var x is not equals to var X.
// There can be no spacing between names of the variables.
// Variable name can start with _, $, or a letter.
// Variable name cannot start with a number, but can end in it.
